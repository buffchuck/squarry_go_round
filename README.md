# squarry_go_round
Just a merry-go-round of squares

This is the second version of the squarry go round app I created just to brush up on some JS, CSS, and HTML skills. 
It is not as granular as version 1. This version of squarry go round uses javascript arrays rather than CSS transition. 
I actually prefer the array method, although I'm not able to control the rate at which the squares move and squares move
even if the previous square has not finished moving. I created this version without caring if the JS code was simple.
